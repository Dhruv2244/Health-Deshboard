A sleek, interactive health dashboard built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts, simulating data from wearable devices. It features mood-based UI themes, responsive design, and animated health metric graphs — perfect for showcasing frontend design and data visualization.

 Mood-Based UI
Users select a mood emoji, and the UI dynamically changes color schemes, animations, and background to reflect that emotion.

 Interactive Graphs: Built using Recharts with tooltips and transitions

 Dark / Light Mode

 Fully Responsive (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)

 Modern UI: Soft shadows, gradients, clean fonts, and animations

 Mood-Based UI Themes
Emoji	Mood	Theme Description
😞	Sad	Muted blue/gray tones, minimal animations
😕	Meh	Dull neutrals with low contrast
😐	Neutral	Balanced colors, standard layout
🙂	Good	Brighter palette, gentle animations
😄	Great	Vibrant colors, energetic animations & glow

Each mood reflects in the UI’s background, text, graph style, and even transitions — making it feel alive and reactive.
